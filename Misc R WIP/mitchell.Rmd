## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages('car',dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages('alr3',dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages('nlme')
```

```{r}
library(alr3)
library(car)
library(ggplot2)

pf = data(Mitchell)
```


```{r}
Mitchell
```
```{r}
range(Mitchell$Month)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(data = Mitchell, aes(x = Month, y = Temp))+
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0, 203, 12))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
