    "# The Enron Corpus\n",
    "## A practice in EDA and Machine Learning\n",
    "##### Tania Lincoln January 15, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Enron was one of the largest corporations in the United States.  By December 2002, it was bankrupt due to widespread corporate fraud and misleading accouting practices.  A Federal investigation resulted where many leaders were found guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enron dataset contains approximately 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation.  It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during Enron's collapse.  At the conclusion of the investigation, the emails and information collected were deemed to be public domain to be used for research or academic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus is unique in that its one of the only public mass collections of real emails available for study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In this project, we will study the corpus to build a person of interest identifier using emails and financial data.  A person of interest is someone who was indicted for fraud, settled, or testified in exchange for immunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will step through the EDA techniques to understand and clean the data; and explain machine learning algorithms applied to identify a person of interest.  Machine learning uses pattern recognition and statistics in a programatically to predict outcomes."
